# Android_compatible_Melbourne_UV_Checker
This code is similar to the other UV Index Checker </br>
but it is Android compatible. </br>
In order to be compatible, it is written in Kivy. </br>
It can be made into an APK using Buildozer in Linux</br>
but requires several dependencies: urllib3, chardet, idna + the standard Buildozer detections.</br>
Be sure to check the Buildozer spec file has asked for network access.
